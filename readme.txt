= What you get =

You get all of the great features packaged with BePro Listings. In addition, this specific addon, allows you to also manage Real Estate specific information:

	1.Show # of rooms, # of bathrooms, # of parking spots and more
	2.Show Status (sold, Sublet, for rent, for sale)
	3.Easily edit this information from the admin

This effectively makes the entire listings experience focused on Real Estate information. Remember, since BePro Listings already features, cost, categories, and other data points, you have everything needed to professionally present your **property** inventory.

= What you Dont get =

There are **no montly fees** with this setup. There is also **no MLS**, **RETS**, **IDX**, or any 3rd party integration. This is a simple way to add Real Estate specific information to the, search, filter, google maps, and other features which are already offered by **BePro Listings** for FREE

This is a major difference that sets us apart from other Real Estate directory plugins. Neither BePro Listings or any of its addons require a monthly fee from you. Our team believes that there is a large population of users who need standalone solutions like ours and we will continue to support that market.

= How it Works =

Realestate details are displayed on the item page. The integration is seamless and guarantees a realestate focused listings experience. Manage the Real Estate details form the edit listing admin page. Items with no value are labelled N/A.
